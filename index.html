<p>This is my resume website! It serves as a showcase of the projects I have worked on in the various areas of CS, as well as providing context and outlining my areas of interest.</p>
<p>I am 23 years old, and graduated Oregon State University in 2019. I have diped my toes into almost every area of programing in my time at OSU. The areas that interest me the most are Web Development, App Development, and Video Game Development. Everything else that I have done that I feel in an indicator of experience in an area cann be found under General Experience. If your interested in seeing what I have do so far, either as part of my coursework at the University or on my own time, feel free to click a link to the left. </p>
<p> While I may have areas where my experience is a bit thin, there is no area of programing I am unwilling to crack into, and I am confident that I can close any experience gap. Just point me in the direction!</p>
