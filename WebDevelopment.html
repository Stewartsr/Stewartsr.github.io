  <h3>PHP - Car Rental Website</h3>
  <div class="desc"><p> [University Work] From the site you can view the available cars (pre-added to the database), sorted by make, color, or location. Users can create a members account, and as a member they can chose to rent a car (only one car per account can be rented at a time) and to leave a review for that specific car. Specific cars can be selected to view the various reviews previous renters have left for it.
